# Scrabble-CSharp

Hello and Welcome to my Scrabble C Sharp project!

I have created this to practice my skills in data structures and algorithms. 
I also am learning the use of external REST/API and I use one for looking up validity of words in a dictionary.

The end goal for this project is to develop a full mobile app. 

I have mostly completed the actual game logic and it works, though I am now learning the mobile development aspect and the game itself is still in the command line stages.
I hope to begin on the actual mobile development of this app soon!

Thank you for viewing my project!
